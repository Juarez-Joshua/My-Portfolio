        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>After I graduated from The University of North Florida, I went into the service industry. Specifically restaurants, where I learned interpersonal skills. Throughout that time I learned that restaurants didn't have the schedule I wanted to maintain. My minor at UNF was Programming which I thoroughly enjoyed and then I enrolled in Thinkful.</p>
