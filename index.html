        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <!-- Start of paragrapgh about me-->
        <p>After I graduated from The University of North Florida, I went into the service industry. Specifically restaurants, where I learned interpersonal skills. Throughout that time I learned that restaurants didn't have the schedule I wanted to maintain. My minor at UNF was Programming which I thoroughly enjoyed and then I enrolled in Thinkful.</p>
        <!-- start of second about me paragraph-->
        <p>In my spare time outside of my career, I find myself going outdoors. That mainly includes playing pickleball, golf, frissbee golf. With that being said I'm also an avid video and board game enthusiast. My favorite games being Valorant and Disney's Villainous.</p>
